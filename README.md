# Fruit Collector

The Fruit Collector is a simple command-line application built in Python that allows users to collect and manage a list of fruits. It enables users to add fruits to a collection, view the list of fruits, and save them to a file (`fruits.txt`).

## Features

- **Add a Fruit**: Allows users to add a new fruit to the collection.
- **Display All Fruits**: Displays all the fruits that have been collected.
- **Save Fruits**: The list of fruits is saved to a file (`fruits.txt`) so it persists between runs.
- **Exit Application**: Exit the application.
